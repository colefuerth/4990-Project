## Choosing a Project

- Mathew's choices are 
  - 50 (B), INDUSTRY 4.0 - Simulation of smart manufacture, Dr. Yacoub
  - 37 (A) evlauation of tools for single-cell RNA-sequencing data analysis, Dr. Rueda

My own choices are:

- 50 (B), INDUSTRY 4.0 - Simulation of smart manufacture, Dr. Yacoub
- 46 (A), Apply machine learning / deep learening to astronomy, Dr. Wu
- 12 (A) vision based obstacle detection, dr. boufama
- 25 (A) Capture Word Semantics in Natural Language using Neural

My choices can be the same as mathew's, but I am writing my proposal based on him doing the project with me. If that is approved, I will see about him replacing lovelesh because the guy is USELESS

## Proposal

```txt
Good afternoon Dr. Arunita Jaekel,

My name is Cole Fuerth, and I am in 4990A; we talked on Friday. I am hoping to do an interdepartmental project using AI, extending an existing project I am working on with Dr. Bala in the Electrical Enginering department.

Over the summer, I have been developing a cloud-based battery fuel gauge (BFG) for the estimation of battery health, characterization, and State of Charge (SoC) estimation. Thus far, the project uses linear algebra-based techniques to perform these tasks, but when using real data, there are only so many factors we can account for in any given battery model. Cloud-based estimation is necessary, since intelligent characterization of batteries takes a lot of resources, and microcontrollers on batteries are simply not powerful enough to perform any more than a basic estimation.

My proposal is, as my 4990 project, I extend this functionality to use AI to estimate battery characteristics. There are many different ways to implement this, and there are no guarantees on how well one technique might work over another, so I plan to try a series of techniques and compare the results. Since I already have a working system (non-AI), I can compare the results of the AI system to the non-AI system to see how well it performs.

AI is necessary to improve this technology further, because no battery modelling algorithms are perfectly accurate, and all have some degree of error. Even today, batteries are a black box when it comes to simulating and predicting their behaviour, and both Dr. Bala and I believe that AI is the best way to improve this technology.

I am also requesting that Mathew Pellarin, who is also in this class, be the second group member for this project. I have worked with him before on many projects, and we complement each other well.

If any additional information is required, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Thank you for your time,

Cole Fuerth
