## Welcome to COMP 4990A F22

Hello class,

Welcome to the first semester of COMP 4990. We will have a lecture only for the *first* week on **Friday Sep 9 at 10:00am** in <u>**Erie Hall 3123**</u>. After that colloquium seminars will normally be scheduled during the lecture slot for the rest of the term. These seminars may be held online or in-person. You are strongly encouraged to attend these seminars

For this course you will be assigned a project and a project supervisor. The project could be an individual project or a group project. Although individual projects are allowed, it is recommended that you work in groups. You may be put in a group with other students interested in same/similar projects. You have two semesters to complete the project. If you are doing a specialization in any area, <u>your project must be related to that area</u>. A list of available projects is posted on BB under the '**F22 Project List**' link. This list may be updated during the first 2 weeks of the term. In order to be matched to a suitable project, you should enter your relevant information and your project choices in order of preference on the excel sheet provided in this [link](https://uwin365-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/arunita_uwindsor_ca/EcqHowGirGdLrZo7RxKH1UEB034Ch3DcbSmAmSvP0DtA-g?e=6iyj37). It is recommended that you enter your selections by **Wednesday Sep 14** to ensure the best chances of getting one of your selected projects.

Please follow the guidelines given below when selecting projects.

- You should log in with your uwindsor id to access the link.
- You should enter your information <u>in the row with your **Name**</u>. If for some reason you do not see your name in the sheet, please add it in the first empty row at the bottom of the sheet.
- Please indicate your degree program, for example BCS[H], Software Engineering, CIS, Applied Computing or a combined major.
- If you are doing one of the specializations under the BCS[H] program(e.g. AI, multimedia etc) please indicate that under the 'Specialization' column; otherwise leave that column blank.
- Indicate your top 4 choices in order of preference in the next four columns under 'Project Choices'. Just insert the project number (as given under **F22 Project List** link), no other details are needed.
  - Each of your project choices must be with a different supervisor. You cannot list more than one project from the same supervisor. This will help ensure a fair distribution of projects.
  - At least 3 of your 4 choices must be from **Group A**. The remaining  choice can be from Group **A** or Group **B**.
- You may be assigned to a project together with other students who are interested in the same/similar projects.
- If you have a preference of which other students you want to work with, please indicate their name(s) under the '**Preferred Team Members**' column. And they should put your name when indicating their preferences. It's fine to leave this field empty, if you do not have any preferences.

I will try my best to match you with one of your preferred projects and your preferred team members. <u>But I cannot guarantee that</u>. Even if a faculty member is offering multiple projects to choose from, that does not mean all their projects will be assigned students this term. Many different factors must be considered including specializations, student preferences and equitable supervision load for faculty. So, you should NOT reach out to individual faculty members until projects have been assigned. This would be unfair to other students who may be interested in the same projects.

Under special circumstances it may be possible to do a student-initiated project. Such projects still need to have a faculty supervisor and must be approved prior to starting. If you are interested in this, you can email me with a detailed project description. I will review the project and if approved will assign a faculty supervisor. You should NOT contact any faculty members directly until the project is approved.

Once project allocations are announced, you will need to enrol yourself in the appropriate blackboard group by Oct 7, 2022. Additional instructions on how to do this will be provided when project allocations are announced. Group submission items, e.g., for the project description report etc. will become visible only after you are enrolled in a group.

Please note that seminar reports are to be submitted individually, but for ALL other components (e.g. project description, final reflection etc) you need ONE submission per group. Any member of the group can submit. But once someone has submitted, no one else can make another submission. So, make sure each group member is aware of what is being submitted, and who is responsible for doing the submission and that you upload the correct final version of your doc.

Hope you have a great semester!

Dr. Arunita Jaekel
