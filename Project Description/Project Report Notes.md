### b. Project Overview: Describe the project & its purpose (300- 400 words)
<!-- 364 words -->
A problem faced today is that most battery estimation algorithms have issues with characterization, and that they require very specifically collected and formatted data. With well written algorithms, characterizing batteries can be a complicated task when working within the field. If brought into a controlled environment, a single test on one battery can take up to 60 hours. Our project hopes to solve these issues using artificial intelligence to determine battery characteristics as well as state of charge and health.\
When charactering batteries, the combine+3 model can be used to describe a batteries internal resistance. K parameters can be estimated to determine the output characterisitics of a battery. Calculating these parameters can be a lengthy process. Instead of this method, artificial intelligence can be used to speed up this process and can hopefully come up with these values instantly while still estimate these values accurately with voltage noise introduced.\
Our project aims to be a stand alone device that can be plugged into any battery managment system and characterise battery cells while in use. This makes it possible to more accuratly estimate the capacity of a battery and deterimne there true battery percentage and output. An example where this could be used is within a electric vehicle. The car may show that it has 15% battery life, but in reality it may only have 5% of its capacity left. This can be a dangerous situation if the car is not able to make it to a charging station. Our device would be able to accurately estimate the battery percentage and output of the car and would be able to tell the driver that they need to charge the car before they can continue driving. Battery life is a major issue in the electric vehicle industry and our device would be able to help solve this issue. Battery percentage are calulated using the state of charge and state of health of the battery. The state of charge is the percentage of the battery that is currently being used, usually determined by how much current has already been used. The state of health is the percentage of the battery that is still usable at 100% capacity. 

### c. Deliverables: Describe all products to be produced (200- 300 words)

<!-- at 219 words -->

A cloud database will be created to store battery data. The data that will be stored is voltage, current and temperature with its timestamp for each unique battery cell. This will be craeted in a mySQL server with the overall goal to run on a amazon web server.
Secondly, a MQTT server will be created to send data to the cloud database. The MQTT server will ensure a secure connection between the battery and the cloud database. All data will be sent to the cloud database in JSON format. \
An artificial intellagence will also be developed to analyize the data and predict the battery life, state of charge and its characteristics. The AI will be built using a neural network and be trained using the data from the cloud database. The AI will be developed using python and tensorflow.
lastly, A device that will be connected to a battery management system and will be able to log all data that the battery management system will squire. This device will be a raspberry pi with custom software that will be able to communicate with the battery management system and update the data stored on the cloud database. From the cloud database, an artificial intelligence model will be able to estimate the state of charge of the battery and its characteristics.


### d. Requirements: Describe the required resources e.g. hw/sw, technical knowledge and skills etc. (100- 200 words)
<!-- 152 words -->

The physical hardware required for this project is a battery management system, batteries and a raspberry pi. The battery management system will ensure the batteries charge and discharge correctly as well as give us the data we need to store in the cloud database. The raspberry pi will be used to log the data from the battery management system and send it to the cloud database. \
For the software, a server with a mySQL server will be required to store the data. A MQTT server will also need to be inplace to send the data to the cloud database. A computer with python and tensorflow will be required to develop the AI. A raspberry pi with custom software will be required to log the data from the battery management system and send it to the cloud database.\
A strong understanding of python, mySQL, MQTT, and tensorflow is required to complete this project.

## PART II.
### 1. Risk analysis (There is no fixed format, as it will vary depending on the nature of the project. For some general guidelines please see the file under the Resources Risks link on BB)
\
**Identify the risk:** The ai will not be able to reconize patterns in the data or tje data will not be accurate enough to train the ai. \
**Estimate the risk cost:** This could cause the project to fail entirely as the ai will not be able to predict accurately.
Estimate the likelihood of the risk: This risk is likely to occur as the ai may not be able to reconize patterns in the data and the ai may not come up with accurate results.\
**Identify the alternative:** If the ai is not able to predict accurately, a different way of predicting the state of charge and characteristics of the battery will need to be found such as using a cache of known batteries and their characteristics.\
**Evaluate and Compare Alternatives:** This alternative will be more time consuming and will require more data to be collected and stored in the cloud database.

**Identify the risk:** Adding noise to data will cause the AI to fail and not be able to predict accurately.\
**Estimate the risk cost:** This may involve us using our design to only demonstrate this on lab collected data and not in the field.\
**Identify the alternative:** Switching to a more direct approach such as lab testing may be needed. This will speed up the charaterization process of the battery.\
**Evaluate and Compare Alternatives:** We need to be able to extract certain features from the data. Performing some preprocessing on the data might help the NN to identify features it cannot identify on its own

**Identify the risk:** 

- Overall there are a number of risks to be taken into consideraton
- the ai cannot train with the given data
  - the data does not contain recognizable patterns
  - the data is not accurate
  - the data might be covering different parts of a curve or be for different chemistries
- bms will not hook up to raspberry pi
- raspberry pi will not be able to send data to the cloud database
- adding noise to the data will cause the ai to not be able to train
- state of health will not be able to be estimated
- Right now the server is running on a local server, we need to migrate to AWS but that may not go as smoothly as we hope
- the database schema might not scale
- 

## PART III. 
### 1. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) (There is no fixed format, as it will vary depending on the nature of the project. For some general guidelines please see the file under the Resourcesïƒ  Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) link on BB)

We have an overall view of milestones we will need 

Deliverable
Modules
Time to Completion



creating the AI 
- create a dataset using some incomplete data, as this is the main goal of the AI project. Noisy, incomplete data is the hardest to predict on
  - create test sample data (perfect data)
    - 5 days
  - train AI with test data
    - 1 day
  - add noise to test data
    - 2 days
  - train AI with noisy data
    - 3 day


develop hardware
- create software to collect data and send to MQTT
  - 3 days
- develop MQTT and mySQL server
  - 1 day
- Create api to pull data from MQTT and send to mySQL
  - 1 day
- Create api to get new data from mySQL data to AI
  - 1 day

- once we have enough data from a large enough sample set of batteries, we can train on that data
- Another feature could be to train a model where, for a certain sample input k-parameters and a voltage, it can predict the soc (another proof of concept)
