- [x] Title Slide
- [x] Introductions
  - [x] cole mat bala and the team in general
- [x] Underlying Concepts
  - [x] why do we care about batteries
  - [x] OCV curves
  - [x] k-parameters
  - [x] characterization
- [x] What is the underlying problem we are trying to solve
  - [x] why characerization is important
  - [x] characterization requires a lot of time and costly equipment
  - [x] characterization on embedded devices is difficult
  - [x] large scale deployment of characterization is difficult
  - [x] Reuse of Batteries
- [ ] The starting point
  - [ ] ELEC8900
  - [ ] CloudBFG
  - [ ] BattSim
- [x] Why an AI can contribute to this problem
  - [x] characterization is hard but if an AI can do it from incomplete data it would be a huge step forward
  - [x] it can be made iteratively more accurate
- [ ] How was the AI implemented (the initial idea)
  - [ ] we started with a few nonsense models that obvs didnt work
  - [ ] The main idea was to use a CNN and encode the data as a kind of genome to be fed into the CNN
  - [ ] basically narrowed it down to a characterization model
